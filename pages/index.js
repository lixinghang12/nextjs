          Semantic scene graph provides an effective way for intelligent agents to better understand the environment and it has been extensively used in many robotic applications. However, existing work mainly focuses on generating the scene graph from
          the sensory information collected from a pre-defined path. To obtain a comprehensive semantic scene graph efficiently, the environment should be exhaustively explored with a carefully
          designed path. In this paper, we propose a new task of Embodied Semantic Scene Graph, which exploits the embodiment of the intelligent agent to autonomously generate a best path to explore
          the environment for scene graph generation. To this end, a learning framework with the paradigms of imitation learning and reinforcement learning is proposed to help the agent generate proper actions to explore the environment and the scene graph is
          incrementally constructed. The proposed method is evaluated on the AI2Thor dataset using both the quantitative and qualitative performance indexes. Additionally, we implement the proposed
          method on a streaming video captioning task and promising experimental results are achieved.
